                <p>Hi there, My name is Ikenna Okonkwo(WD) and yes, it is my picture at the left. I will share my experiences and the skills I've acquired along the way. I am currently learning about CSS and how to style web pages effectively. Using CSS, I can create visually appealing layouts, control the appearance of texts, and enhance the overall user experience of my websites.
                </p><br>

                <p>I started learning CSS in 2022 first when i had just entered the univesity and needed a skill of my own. Unfortunatley for me, the laptop i had at the time had spoilt and that made me discontinue my learning for a while. Now i have a new laptop and I am back to learning about web dev with more determination than ever! </p><br>

                <p>I have always wanted to help people in the best way i know how to. A website can help people whose different businesses has not gotten to the supposed audiendce, it could also help to display information to the public world. It could also be used for transfer of information from two people from two differnt people, like sharing apps and music, etc.</p><br>


                <p></p>

                <p>Some factors are restricting me from going after this career but regardless, if praise, on X as <a href="https://x.com/plaw_04?s=11">plaw_04?</a>, Bruce on X as <a href="https://x.com/bruce1offordile?s=11">bruce1offordile</a> and a few others could do it, then it obviouly means that i can too and that i, <a href="https://x.com/ikenna6868?s=21">Ikenna,</a> would have to be hardworking and play my part. Afterall, the motto is <strong>Do what you love and love what you do.</strong> So i am out here for whatever.<br>
                Remember that 21 savage, drake and j.cole are the big three in the hip hop world. You are welcome.</p>

                <p>
                    Ohh well, <i> you already know how it goes...</i>
                </p>

                <p>As I continue my journey, I will keep updating this section with new skills and projects I undertake. Stay tuned for more updates! Peace!</p><br>
