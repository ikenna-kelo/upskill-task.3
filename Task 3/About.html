                <p>Hi there, my name is Ikenna Okonkwo(WD) and yes,it is my picture at the left. I will share my experiences and the skills I've acquired along the way.I am currently learning about CSS and how to style web pages effectively. using CSS, I can create visually appealing layouts, control the appearance of text, and enhance the overall user experience of my websites.
                </p>

                <p>I started learning CSS in 2022 first when i had just entered the univesity and needed a skill of my own. unfortunatley for me, the laptop i had at the time had spoilt and that made me discontinue my learning for a while. Now i have a new laptop and I am back to learning about web dev with more determination than ever! </p>

                <p>I have always looked up to those into tech and basketball beacuse they looked rich, fresh, and cool. some dress in a way the Nigerian context would call irresponsible while at the same time responsibe if you get what i mean.</p>


                <p>You know, tech bros got a nice ring to it and this is another reason why i decided to embark on this journey of no return. I am doing this for the love i have for these two professions, and i am working hard to excel at both or either of them so i can afford travelling around the world and also be able to work from whereever i'm at.</p>

                <p>Some factors are restricting me from going after this career but regardless, if praise, on X as <a href="https://x.com/plaw_04?s=11">plaw_04?</a>, Bruce on X as <a href="https://x.com/bruce1offordile?s=11">bruce1offordile</a> and a few others could do it, then it obviouly means that i can too and that i, <a href="https://x.com/ikenna6868?s=21">Ikenna,</a> would have to be hardworking and play my part. Afterall, the motto is <strong>Get rich or die trying</strong> so i am out here for whatever.<br>
                Trying playing 21 savage, drake or j.cole while writing your codes to enjoy it. Thank me later.</p>

                <p>
                    Ohh well, <i> you already know how it goes...</i>
                </p>

                <p>As I continue my journey, I will keep updating this section with new skills and projects I undertake. Stay tuned for more updates! Peace!</p><br>
